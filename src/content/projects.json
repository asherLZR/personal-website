It includes simple, back-to-basic rules which emulate over-the-board play, and is of course, sans ads! It was implemented with Typescript React and Node.js with Socket.IO."

		"description": "While it is agreed that one of the best modes of learning is through teaching, this is rarely tapped upon. The proposal was to build a video learning website where the content creators are students. Students upload videos of themselves teaching different topics within a unit, soliciting feedback from their peers. The code written here was written under time pressure for presentation purposes only."

It was my first foray into Android programming and was instructive in design thinking within the Object-Oriented paradigm. Functional and reactive programming were disallowed. The app uses Strategy & Adapter patterns and demonstrates SOLID principles."
